*) npm init [To create a new Backent project, we will get package.json]
   package.json has Domain name, which version we are using, some dependencies.
*) npm i axios [this is a third party code, we can use it just by doing command]
    when we install axiso, we will get extra 2 files, package-lock.json & node_modules.
    The node_modules:- folder is where npm stores all the installed dependencies (and their dependencies) for your project.
    package-lock.json:- A file automatically generated by npm when dependencies are installed. 
                        It provides a precise record of the exact dependency tree and their versions used in your project.
                        It Helps track the dependency tree's state and makes debugging easier if issues arise due to updates.

Aspect	            node_modules	                                    package-lock.json
What            it is	Directory containing installed packages.	File that locks the exact dependency tree.
Purpose	        Makes dependencies usable in the project.	        Ensures exact versions for reproducibility.
Generated When	Created during npm install.	                        Created or updated during npm install.
Size	        Can be large (all dependency files).	            Small, just metadata about dependencies.

*) axios:-
    Axios is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests. 
    It is widely used in both client-side and server-side JavaScript applications to interact with APIs or other web services. 
    Below are its use cases and benefits:
    Examples:- 
    1. Fetching Data from APIs
    Axios is commonly used to send GET requests to fetch data from APIs.
    axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => {
        console.log(response.data);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
      });
    OR
    const axios = require('axios');    //Normal JS     OR
    import axios from 'axios';        //m.js(module exo-system) & also we have to mention in package.json "type":"module", It is a ES6 module syntax.
    const main = async () =>{
        const data = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
        console.log(data);
    }
    main();

    2. Sending Data to APIs
    You can use Axios to send POST, PUT, or PATCH requests to submit or update data.
    axios.post('https://api.example.com/data', {
      name: 'John',
      age: 30
    })
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });

    3. Handling Authentication
    4. File Uploads
    5. Downloading Files
    6. Customizing Requests
    7. Global Request and Response Interceptors
    8. Retry Failed Requests
