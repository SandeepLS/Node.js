Node.js:-it provides lot of different features, one of them Non-Blocking I/O, another one is Node Package Manager.
when we install nodejs, we will get the npm as well.

npm:- Node Package Manager. As a developer when they build application/websites we need to use external dependencies, external libreries so we can do everything from the scretch,we can write entire application by ourself.
node have lot of inbuilt modules like http, 
if u have work with file System, we have a module for that,
if u have work with cryptography, we have a module for that, so nodejs has some inbuilt modules, wt if u want extra modules, or wt if u wants use someone else modules, and that's will the concept of npm.

npm it has million of packages available.like 
    socket.io(we can create real-time servers/Data sending),
    mongodb(we connecting for back-end purpose),
    express(it is a framework of web development in Node.js)(npm install express).
    
Basically u can use all the packages,just we can fetch them,& install on ur machine and use them.
And u can also push your packages, you have a module, which you have created, so u can push that module to the gitHub and entire world will be use it.(npmjs.com)
