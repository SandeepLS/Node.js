Node.js:-it provides lot of different features, one of them Non-Blocking I/O, another one is Node Package Manager.
when we install nodejs, we will get the npm as well.

npm:- Node Package Manager. As a developer when they build application/websites we need to use external dependencies, external libreries so we can do everything from the scretch,we can write entire application by ourself.
node have lot of inbuilt modules like http, 
if u have work with file System, we have a module for that,
if u have work with cryptography, we have a module for that, so nodejs has some inbuilt modules, wt if u want extra modules, or wt if u wants use someone else modules, and that's will the concept of npm.

npm it has million of packages available.like 
    socket.io(we can create real-time servers/Data sending),
    mongodb(we connecting for back-end purpose),
    express(it is a framework of web development in Node.js)(npm install express).
    
Basically u can use all the packages,just we can fetch them,& install on ur machine and use them.
And u can also push your packages, you have a module, which you have created, so u can push that module to the gitHub and entire world will be use it.(npmjs.com)
npm is a part of gitHub and gitHub is a part of microsoft.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Modules/Package:- modules as a small Encapsulated Unit, which u can reuse, which u can share with everyone. and which are the easier to maintain.
Ex: We have a big Problem but solve a big problem, the first step is the Breakdown our bigproblem into small problems, and each small problem will have a small solution, & u can name that small solutions are a problem.
And the exact of macking small part it is easier to maintain, it is easier to share , and also debug. Manitainance, Sharing, Debugging is more Important. this concept is called Module.
example, u can create a module,which u can connect to an database,/ which u can write data to a file,/which good for calculation.
u can share this module everyone in this world theyy can use it. and we can publih our module to a npm.

Ex1:-add.js
function add(a,b){        //the server create the function, which will be give to Output/
    return a+b;
}
result = add(4,5);        //call the function
console.log("This is the output:"+result);


Ex2:-We created our own module
(i)add.js:-This is our pgm
var calc = require('./calc.js')

result = calc(4,5);
console.log("This is the output:"+result);

--------OR-------
var calc = require('./calc.js')
result = calc.add(4,5);
console.log("This is the output:"+result);


(ii)calc.js:-This is our module
function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
module.exports = add;    //Basically we explore all the function, which u want the outsaid user.

-----OR-----
exports.add = function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
