IS Node.js is Single threaded?
Yes, Node.js is single-threaded, but it utilizes a non-blocking,-
event-driven architecture to handle multiple operations concurrently/Synchronously/Simultaneously.

How Node.js Handles Tasks:
1. Single-Threaded Event Loop:
   The main part of Node.js runs on a single thread, meaning it processes one tasks at a time in a loop (event loop).

2. Concurrency with Callbacks/Promises:
   Node.js handles concurrent tasks using callbacks, promises, and async/await,
   allowing multiple tasks to execute asynchronously without waiting for each other to complete.
