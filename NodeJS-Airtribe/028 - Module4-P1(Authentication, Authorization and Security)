Authentication, Authorization:-

Authentication:
  Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. 
  is we want to check, if this particuler user can access the system/Not.  

  It answers the question: "Who are you?"
  Example: Logging in with a username and password.
  After successful authentication, the server typically issues a token (e.g., JWT).

Steps in Authentication:
  > The user sends their credentials (e.g., username and password).
  > The server verifies the credentials against the database.
  > If valid, the server responds with a token.
  > The token is used to, authenticate the user in subsequent requests.

Implementation Example:
Hereâ€™s an example using JWT for token-based authentication.
Dependencies:
npm install express bcrypt jsonwebtoken
