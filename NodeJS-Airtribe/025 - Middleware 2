Middleware:-  
Here we use app.use(express.json()); middleware.
What is middleware does it:- this middleware 
Adds the req.body to the req.object, so each route handler function is going to receive a req & res object.
And by default express does not  add the req body to the req object,
in order to add the req body to the req object we need to use the express.json()Â middleware.

Ex:
When a client make a req to the express app, express app is gooing to send some response to the client.
But, In b/w req is recive & response is send, there are few things which happens, (Req is recive, Res is send)
is called ReqRes cycle.
Ehenever the expressApp recive the req from client, It first create Req & Res Object.
This is the same req & Res Object, Which is recived an argument for the route handler function. 

This data(Req/Res object) will be used and process, In order to generate & send back meaningfull response.
In order to process the data in express, we use something called middleware,
This middleware can manipulate req or res object,-
//middleware
....
next();
middleware can also be used, execute any other core object,
Ex: we use express.json() middleware, to get the req body from the req object.

Midlleware is function, that gets executed in b/w reciving a req & sending a response,
Even the routes, which be define that is also middleware in express.
