1. Synchronous Execution
  In synchronous execution, tasks are performed one after the other, in sequence.
  A task must complete, before the next one starts.
  Ex:-
    console.log("Start");
    
    // Simulating a time-consuming task
    function delayTask() {
      for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {} // Simulates delay
      console.log("Task completed");
    }
    delayTask();
    console.log("End");

    O/P:
    Start
    Task completed  //Here, the program waits for delayTask() to finish before moving to the next task.
    End

2. Asynchronous Execution
  In asynchronous execution, tasks can be initiated and allowed to run in the background. 
  The program does not wait for a task to complete, before starting the next one. Instead, 
  it continues executing the rest of the code, while the task is handled in the background.
  Ex:
    console.log("Start");
    
    // Simulating an asynchronous task
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Task completed");
    }, 2000);
    
    console.log("End");
    
    O/P:-
    Start
    End
    Task completed

  Aspect	    Synchronous	                                              Asynchronous
  Execution	  Tasks are executed one at a time.	                        Tasks can run concurrently.
  Blocking	  The program waits for a task to finish before moving on.	The program doesnâ€™t wait; it continues executing.
  Efficiency	Slower if tasks take time to complete.	                  Faster and more responsive.
  Example     Reading a file line by line.	                            Fetching data from a server (API calls).


When to Use Which
  Synchronous: When tasks depend on each other, or you need results immediately 
  (e.g., reading a local file for small configurations).
  
  Asynchronous: When tasks are independent, involve waiting
  (e.g., I/O operations, database queries, network calls), or can be done in parallel for better performance.
