What is Diff BW Node.js & AJAX ?
Ans:
Node.js is sever-side runtime environment, while
AJAX is client-side technique, for asynchronously updating part of a web page(ex: HTTP request).

Node.js is, Runs on the server (built on Chrome's V8 engine), while
AJAX is Runs in the browser (JavaScript in the frontend).

Node.js is Used for building backend services, APIs, and handling database operations, while
AJAX is Used for fetching data from the server and updating web pages without reloading.

Node.js is Usage: Backend development, REST APIs, WebSockets, file handling, etc, While
AJAX is Usage: Fetching dynamic content, form submission, live updates, etc.

Node.js is supports asynchronous I/O operations, while
AJAX is performs asynchronous HTTP requests.

Example
Node.js is A web server handling multiple client requests, while
AJAX is Fetching new data without reloading the page (e.g., live search).

Example of Node.js (Backend Server):-
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  
  app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
      res.json({ message: "Hello from Node.js server!" });
  });
  
  app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

Example of AJAX (Client-side JavaScript):-
  fetch('/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data.message));


> Node.js is for backend development (server-side).
> AJAX is for fetching data dynamically in the frontend.
