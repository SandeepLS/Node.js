*)Put method:-
  Use PUT when you want to replace, the entire resource with a new one. 
  This means we must include all fields in the request, even if only one field is being updated.
  Example:
  Suppose you have a resource:
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Old Course",
    "rating": 4.0,
    "description": "An old description"
  }
  
  PUT Request: PUT /api/v1/courses/1
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Updated Course",
    "rating": 5.0,
    "description": "An updated description"
  }
  Result: The entire resource is replaced, so all fields must be included in the payload.

*)Patch method:-
  Use PATCH when you want to modify specific fields of a resource without affecting others.
  Example:
  Suppose you have the same resource:
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Old Course",
    "rating": 4.0,
    "description": "An old description"
  }
  
  PATCH Request: PATCH /api/v1/courses/1
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "rating": 5.0
  }
  
  Result: Only the rating field is updated. The other fields remain unchanged:
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Old Course",
    "rating": 5.0,
    "description": "An old description"
  }
