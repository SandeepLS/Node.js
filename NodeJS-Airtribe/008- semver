Semantic versioning (semver) in Node.js:-
is a versioning convention that uses a three-part number system: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
Itâ€™s widely adopted in package management, including Node.js with npm. 

Here's a breakdown of each part:
MAJOR: Incremented for breaking changes, which are incompatible with previous versions.
MINOR: Incremented for new features that are backward-compatible.
PATCH: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

Example: 1.4.2 (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
If you make breaking changes: 2.0.0
If you add new backward-compatible features: 1.5.0
If you fix bugs without breaking anything: 1.4.3
