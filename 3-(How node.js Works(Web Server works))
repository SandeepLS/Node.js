Node.js has a two concept 
(i)Non-blocking I/O(it get the request from the client,the server tell to worker, i got a request, go to ther server and get to the response.) 
and
(ii)Ascynchronous(it get the response from the another server and fetch into the client request).
it has a frame work libuv for non-blocking I/O.
libuv it built in c, which uses system kernel, in kernel have multiple threads.
In Node.js you are not using multiple threat,but behind the seen, your kernel is implementing multiple threads.
