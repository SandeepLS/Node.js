What is a SECRET_KEY in JWT:-
The SECRET_KEY is a private string, that the server uses to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
It plays two essential roles:
1. Signing the Token:
  > When the server creates a JWT using jwt.sign(), it uses the SECRET_KEY, to generate a unique signature.
  > The signature ensures that, the token cannot be tampered with.
  > If someone tries to modify the token data (like the username), the signature will no longer match, and the token becomes invalid.
  
2. Verifying the Token:
  > When the server receives a JWT (e.g., in the /profile route), it uses the same SECRET_KEY, 
    to check the token's signature and validate its integrity.
  > If the SECRET_KEY used to verify doesn't match the one used to sign the token,
    the verification fails, and the token is considered invalid.
