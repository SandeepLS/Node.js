Web Services:- We have a client, which is your browser.
          then we have a web service, which wll be on a server.
          the server nedd to have a uniqe IP address.
Normally, whenever server we access, it may be google.com, google server,
every server will have the IP address. And the only way to reach there with the IP address.
If we want reach the HTTP services/server, we have to mention 2 thinks:1)IP address, 2)Port number.

Ex:-
var http = require('http')          //the 'http' module is imported

http.createServer(function(req,res){  //The http.createServer function is called to create an HTTP server.
    res.write("Welcome back Aline!!!")
    res.end()
}).listen(8080)

/*Explaination
Step:1) Create the function called createServer,which will give you service(it is a create a server for us).
createServer()

Step:2)And this server takes a function,whenever we call the server it will execute a function.
createServer(function())

Step:3) And this function accept two parameter
1st parameter is something which recived from the client.
2nd parameter is something you want to sent the client.
createServer(function(req,res))

When we have a client server archtecture, the client sent the request, the server sent the response.

Step:4) we have to sent the response back to the client.(res.write())
and we have to mention end statement.(res.end())
createServer(function(req,res){
    res.write("Welcome back Aline")
    res.end()
})

Step:5) The create server, which is function will be calling, so we have to mention where this create server exist.
the create function is available in the module is called HTTP.
var http = require('http)
createServer(function(req,res){
    res.write("Welcome back Aline")
    res.end()
})

Step:6) so here in this create server, if you want to call create server -> we have to use http.createServer (Because createServer belongs to http).
var http = require('http)
http.createServer(function(req,res){
    res.write("Welcome back Aline")
    res.end()
})

Step:7) we have to mention Port number
.listen(8080)
*/

----------------OR------------------------
/*It includ header(Status -> 200)*/
var http = require('http')

http.createServer(function(req,res){
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type':'text/html'})
    res.end("Welcome back Aline!!!")
}).listen(8080)

/*res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type':'text/html'}):-
In this line, the res.writeHead method is used to set the HTTP response headers.
It specifies that the response has an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) and a content type of 'text/plain', indicating that the response will be in plain text format.
