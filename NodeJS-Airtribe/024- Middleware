middleware:- Before every request comming to the server,
             make sure it will go through the middleware function.
             In that i will have some common coding, that code will get executed,
             then post request(this handler) will get executed.

Middleware:- It refers to functions, that have access to the request object (req),
    response object (res), and the next function (next) in the application’s request-response cycle. 
    Middleware functions can execute code, modify the request or response objects, end the request-response cycle,
    or call the next function to pass control to the next middleware function, in the stack.

Primary use of express.json() middleware:-
    To parse JSON payload from incoming request.

Middkeware in Express.js?:-
Middleware function are executed in the order, they are added to app.

In your Express application, you need to restrict access to certain routes. What is the best approach to implement this authorization feature?
Implement middleware that verifies permission before processing req.

Middleware is commonly used for:
  Logging requests
  Handling authentication/authorization
  Parsing request bodies
  Handling errors
  Serving static files

Types of Middleware:
1/ Application-level middleware: 
   These are bound to an instance, of an Express application using app.use() or app.METHOD() (e.g., app.get(), app.post(), etc.).
   Ex:
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    
    // Application-level middleware
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log('Request received at:', new Date().toISOString());
      next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
    });
    
    app.get('/home', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Welcome to Home Page');
    });
    
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server running on port 3000');
    });

2/ Router-level middleware: Similar to application-level, but attached to an express.Router() instance.
   Ex:
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();
    
    // Router-level middleware
    router.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log('Router-level middleware running');
      next();
    });
    
    router.get('/tasks', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Task List');
    });
    
    app.use('/api', router); // Use the router in the app

3/ Error-handling middleware: Middleware that handles errors by taking four arguments (err, req, res, next). 
   It can be defined to catch errors and send appropriate responses.
   Ex:
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
      console.error(err.stack);
      res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
    });

4/ Built-in middleware: Express provides built-in middleware like express.json() to parse incoming JSON payloads,
   express.urlencoded() for URL-encoded data, and express.static() for serving static files.
   Ex:
    app.use(express.json()); // Parses JSON requests

5/  Third-party middleware: Middleware that is created by the community and can be added via npm,
    such as body-parser, morgan, cors, etc.
    Ex:
    const morgan = require('morgan');
    app.use(morgan('dev')); // Logging requests
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
use case of middleware:-
Middleware in Express.js has several important use cases. Here are a few key examples:

Authentication:
    Checking if a request is coming from an authenticated user before processing it further.

Authorization:
    Ensuring the user has permission to perform the requested action.

CORS Handling: 
    Setting headers to allow cross-origin requests where necessary.

Logging:
    Recording details of requests, such as timestamp, request type, and user agent information, for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Validation/Sanity Checks: 
    Checking incoming requests for required fields and ensuring data integrity before proceeding to request handlers.
