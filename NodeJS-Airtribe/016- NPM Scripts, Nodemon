An npm script:- is a command defined in the package.json file of a Node.js project,
used to automate common tasks, such as running build processes, tests, or running servers.

Ex:-package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js"
  }
}
You can run these scripts using the npm run command in your terminal.
For example, to start the server defined by "start": "node app.js", you would run:
npm run start
npm start

Nodemon:-
What we have to restart our server, every single time we are macking anything,
And that's not really great developer, to solve this bug, we are going to use, yet another module called nodemone.
what nodemone going to do is, it go head & watch our .json file, & every time save over file/everytime changes in a file,
it is going to restart our file.

Nodemon:- is a tool that helps develop Node.js-based applications by automatically,-
restarting the server, when file changes are detected in the directory.
It watches the files in your project and restarts the Node.js server when any changes are made.

Installing Nodemon:-
  Global installation (available across all projects):
  npm install -g nodemon
  
  Local installation (for a specific project):
  npm install nodemon --save-dev

Ex:- after install the nodemon dependency, script look like this:
    {
    "scripts": {
        "start": "nodemon app.js"
      },
      "author": "san",
      "license": "ISC",
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.21.0"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "nodemon": "^3.1.7"
      }
    }
    CLG: npm run start
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nodemon: if i change any content in my file, i want to start my server again&again. So if i use nodemon
         we make changes in a file, it is going to restart pur server automatically.
