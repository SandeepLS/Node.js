NodeJs is a single threaded.
NodeJS is an asynchronous javaScript runtime build on the chrom's, v8 runtime engine.
[it is a JavaScript Runtime environment which uses Vite8 javascript engine.]
Ex: Runtime environment:- which allowes we to run JavaScript, outsaid of the web browser.
In simple word, NodeJS is server sided javascript.

Single-threaded:- only one task running in sequential flow. (Do one think at a time).
  Advantage: Simplicity- No need to manage multiple threads, reducing complexity in code.
Thread: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.

Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and follows a single-threaded architecture for executing JavaScript code. 
However, Node.js cannot handle multiple tasks efficiently. 
It uses an event loop and asynchronous non-blocking I/O to manage concurrency.
  
Why NodeJS:-
Lightweight and very fast.
Many connection can be handled like, Asynchronous and event driven.

Where to use NodeJS:-
->I/O bound application
->Data streaming application
->JSON API based application

Key feature of NodeJS:-
  ->Single threaded.
  ->Non0blocking.
  ->Asynchronous architecture.

Blocking V/S Non-Blocking:-
  ->Blocking methods execute synchronously like: variable, function, for, if else, while console.log(), DOM api.
    Non-Blocking methods execute Asynchronously like web API: fetch, promises, setTimeout, setInterval, FS.
  
  ->Blocking is when the execution of the code waits, until the currently running operation completes. 
    Non-Blocking is when the execution of the code does more work, until the currently running operation completes.
  
  ->Examples:-
    (i)Blocking Example (Synchronous Code):-
    Ex:In blocking code, the next line of code will not execute, until the current operation completes.
    const fs = require('fs');
    const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log('File content:', data);
    console.log('This will print after file reading is done.');
  
    O/P:-Sandeeep
         This will print after file reading is done.
  
    (ii)Non-Blocking Example (Asynchronous Code):-In non-blocking code, the operation is initiated,
    and the next lines of code are executed immediately, without waiting for the previous operation to complete.
    Ex:
    const fs = require('fs');
    fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error(err);
            return;
        }
        console.log('File content:', data);
    });
    console.log('This will print before file reading is done.');

    O/P:-This will print after file reading is done.
