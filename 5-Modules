Modules/Package:- modules as a small Encapsulated Unit, which u can reuse, which u can share with everyone. and which are the easier to maintain.
Ex: We have a big Problem but solve a big problem, the first step is the Breakdown our bigproblem into small problems, and each small problem will have a small solution, & u can name that small solutions are a problem.
And the exact of macking small part it is easier to maintain, it is easier to share , and also debug. Manitainance, Sharing, Debugging is more Important. this concept is called Module.
example, u can create a module,which u can connect to an database,/ which u can write data to a file,/which good for calculation.
u can share this module everyone in this world theyy can use it. and we can publih our module to a npm.

Ex1:-add.js
function add(a,b){        //the server create the function, which will be give to Output/
    return a+b;
}
result = add(4,5);        //call the function
console.log("This is the output:"+result);


Ex2:-We created our own module
(i)add.js:-This is our pgm
var calc = require('./calc.js')

result = calc(4,5);
console.log("This is the output:"+result);

--------OR-------
var calc = require('./calc.js')
result = calc.add(4,5);
console.log("This is the output:"+result);


(ii)calc.js:-This is our module
function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
module.exports = add;    //Basically we explore all the function, which u want the outsaid user.

-----OR-----
exports.add = function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
