HTTP and HTTPS are both protocols used for transferring data over the internet,
but HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP.
->Http will have request & response architecture.
->Http request will have URL, Body, Method. Response will have statusCode, Body.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)HTTP:- is a protocol, used for transferring data between a client (browser) and a server. 
       It is the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web.

    Request-Response Architecture:
      > A client sends an HTTP request to the server.
      > The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response with the requested data.

    Components of HTTP Request:
      > URL: Specifies the resource's location on the server (e.g., a webpage or API endpoint).
      > Body: Contains data to send to the server, used primarily in methods like POST or PUT.
      > Method: Specifies the action to be performed (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    
    Response: Contains:
      > Status Code: Indicates the result of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
      > Body: The content returned by the server, such as an HTML page or JSON data.

2)HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):-
    HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the data transferred between the client and the server, 
    ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

    HTTPS uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) for encryption.

Summary of Differences:-
Feature  	  HTTP	                                      HTTPS
Security	  No encryption; data is sent in plain text.	Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
Port	      Uses port 80 by default.	                  Uses port 443 by default.
Use Case	  Suitable for non-sensitive data.	          Essential for sensitive data (e.g., login, payment).
Certificate	No SSL/TLS certificate required.	          Requires an SSL/TLS certificate.

HTTP methods:-are used in the web development, to communicate actions b/w clients & servers.
Here are the most common HTTP methods:-
1/ Get:
  Retrieves data from server.
  Ex:Fetching a list of products.

2/ Post:
  Send data to the server, to create new resource.
  Typically used, when submiting forms or sending data to APIs.
  Ex:Submiting new product to the server.

3/ Put:
  Updates or replaces an exisiting resource on the server.
  Ex:Updating an entire product record in database.
  
4/Patch:
  Partially updates a resource on the server.
  Ex: Updating just price of product.

5/Delete:
  Delete a resource on the server.
  Ex:Removing a product from the database.

Explaination:
Imagin we walking to restorent, an ask for the menu.(that's a Get request),
Now we decide order the pizza,(that's weare Post request),means insert/add new data.(In api word creating a order/creating new account),
Now we want to modify our order(here Put will come),It will change from pizza to pastha,
Then we want to adding extra spice/chees(here Patch request come),
& finally not if we hungry any more, we descide to cancel our order,(Here Delete method will come)
