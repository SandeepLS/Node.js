What is REPL in Node.js:-
REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. 
It is a built-in interactive shell in Node.js, that allows developers to execute JavaScript code in real time.

How REPL Works
The REPL follows a four-step process:
  Read → Takes input from the user.
  Eval → Evaluates the JavaScript expression.
  Print → Outputs the result.
  Loop → Waits for the next input (repeats the cycle).

How to Start REPL in Node.js:-
To open the REPL, simply run the following command in your terminal:
node
You'll see a prompt (>) where you can type JavaScript code and execute it.

Basic REPL Commands
1. Execute JavaScript Expressions:
  > 5 + 5
  10
  > Math.max(10, 20, 30)
  30

2. Variable Declaration
  > let x = 10;
  undefined
  > x * 2
  20

3. Multiline Code Execution
  Use .editor mode to write multi-line code:
  > .editor
  // Now write JavaScript code
  let a = 5;
  let b = 10;
  console.log(a + b);
  (ctrl + D to execute)

4. Load External Files
  To run an external JavaScript file in REPL:
  > .load myScript.js

5. Exit REPL
  > .exit
  # OR use Ctrl + C (twice)

Why Use REPL?
> Test small JavaScript snippets quickly.
> Debug Node.js applications interactively.
> Explore built-in modules (fs, http, etc.).
