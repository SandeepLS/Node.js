Express: is a simple & light weight framework, 
which simulate a process of creating a web server & api/NodeJS.

To create a first web server:-
Step1:-Create a server
app.js:-
const express = require('express');
const app = express();    //we need to create, one instence of this express & we call the constructor function() of express.

//start server
app.listen(3000, () =>{    //this fun() is going to take two parameter, 1st is PortNum, 2nd is callback().
    console.log('server is up and running on port 3000...');
})
/*the req is definetly going to our webServer, but our server is no idea, How to handle this particuler / route.
this is going to be a getReq, but our server is no idea, How to handle the getReq (Connect GET /).
*/

Step2:-Handle the get response

const app = express();    

app.listen(3000, () =>{ 
    console.log('server is up and running on port 3000...');
})

//Here handle this particuler / route or URL(/).
app.get('/',(req,res) =>{    
    res.send("Hello world");
