API(Application Programming Interface):-
is a set of rules & definitions, That allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

Purpose of API, It enable integration & interaction between different systems,
macking it possible to share data & functionality.

Example:- Imagin it's my first day at school, i will go to our class-teacher[API],
and i ask some kind of information[API request] like Time-table, Name of subject teacher, materials etc.
Now teacher will ask my details(profile)[parameter] like Name , RollNum.
Then teacher goes to the office room, she retrive all data based on my profile.
& She gave us all mandatory information[API response].

Types:-
  1. Web APIs: Allows communication, over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS
     Ex:
     A. REST: Uses HTTP method like GET, POST, PUT & DELETE. often uses JSON for data.
     B. SOAP: Uses XML and is known for strong security & transaction support.
     C. GraphQL: Allows client, to request specific data they need. Making data retrival efficient.
     D. WebSocket API: It enables real-time, two-way communication b/w the client & server, over a persistent connection.
  
  2. Library APIs: It provided by software libraries, to interact with their feature.
  3. Operating System APIs: It Enable applications to interact with the OS.
  4. Database APIs: Allows applications to communicate with database.

API Component:-
  1. Endpoint: The specific URL, where the API can be accessed.
               http://localhost:3000/restfulservices/v1/users/{id}
  2. Request & Respons:
     The Request from the client includes Parameters, Headers & Body.
     The Response from the server includes status-code & data.
  
  3. Methods: are GET(retrive data), POST(submit data), PUT(update data), DELETE(remove data).
  
  4. Authentication & Authorization: Ensure the only authorized clients, can access the API.
     Common methods include API keys & tokens.

Example of API usage:-
  -> Social Media Integration.
  -> Payment Getway.
  -> Maps & Location Services.
  -> Messaging Services.

Benefits of APIs:-
  Modularity: It allows building applications in parts, independently.
  Integration: It facilitates interaction b/w different systems.
  Efficiency: Speeds up development, by reusing existing component.
  Scalability: Makes it easier to scale parts of the system independently.
