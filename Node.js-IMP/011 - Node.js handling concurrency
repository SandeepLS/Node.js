How Node.js handling concurrency despite being single-threaded ?
Ans: Node.js handles concurrency through asynchronous, non-blocking operations,
allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously within a single thread.

Concurrency: Handling multiple tasks at once, but not necessarily executing them at the same time.

Synchronous = Blocking
Asynchronous = Non-Blocking
