Protocol:- is a set of rules, standards, or procedures that define how data is transmitted,
and received between devices, systems, or programs in a network.
Protocols ensure that communication is structured, reliable, and understood by all parties involved.

Types of Protocols:-

1. Network Communication Protocols:-
    Define how data is transferred over a network.
    Examples:
    HTTP/HTTPS: For accessing websites and web services.
    FTP (File Transfer Protocol): For transferring files.
    SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): For sending emails.

2. Transport Layer Protocols
    Handle data delivery between devices.
    Examples:
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data.
    UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Sends data quickly but without guaranteed delivery.
3. Internet Protocols
    Manage addressing and routing of data across networks.
    Examples:
    IP (Internet Protocol): Routes packets between devices.
    IPv4/IPv6: Versions of IP with different address formats.

4. Security Protocols
    Ensure secure communication.
    Examples:
    SSL/TLS: Encrypts data for secure transmission (used in HTTPS).
    IPSec: Secures data at the IP layer.
    
5. Application Layer Protocols
    Support specific applications or services.
    Examples:
    DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
    DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Assigns IP addresses to devices automatically.

Why Are Protocols Important:-
Standardization: Allow devices and systems from different manufacturers to communicate.
Reliability: Ensure data is transmitted without corruption or loss.
Security: Protect data from unauthorized access and tampering.
Efficiency: Optimize data transfer to minimize delays and resource usage.
