Web Server:- it wil be having WebApplication and that WA access by client.
for ex:- the client request to server ,for i want currnt data about today match. in this case the server will say ok, i will give data.
        but the were the server gives to data, the server requesting to other server to get the data,
        maybe the server getting data from the DataBase,
        maybe the server getting data from the FileSystem.
if the server is requesting to other server or database, it will take some time to give data(1sec or 2sec)

Node.js has a two concept:-
(i)Non-blocking I/O(it get the request from the client,the server tell to worker, i got a request, go to ther server and get to the response.) 
and
(ii)Ascynchronous(it get the response from the another server and fetch into the client request).
it has a frame work libuv for non-blocking I/O.
libuv it built in c, which uses system kernel, in kernel have multiple threads.
In Node.js you are not using multiple threat,but behind the seen, your kernel is implementing multiple threads.
