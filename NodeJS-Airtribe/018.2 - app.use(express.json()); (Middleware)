The line app.use(express.json()); in your Express application is middleware,
that allows our server, to parse incoming JSON payloads in the body of HTTP requests. 

1. What is Middleware in Express?
Middleware in Express is a function, that intercepts incoming requests, and
processes them before they reach our route handlers, or after the route handlers have executed.
  It can:
  Parse request data.
  Authenticate users.
  Log request details.
  Handle errors.
The middleware app.use(express.json()) is specifically for parsing JSON data.

2. What Does express.json() Do?
  Parses the Body: It parses the body of incoming requests that have a Content-Type of application/json.
  Attaches the Data to req.body: After parsing, the JSON data is attached to the req.body property, 
  making it accessible in your route handlers.
  
  For example: If you send a POST request with the following JSON payload:
  {
    "title": "Inception",
    "year": 2010,
    "rating": 8.8,
    "actor": ["Leonardo", "Joseph", "Ellen"]
  }
  
  After the request is processed by express.json(), you can access this data in your route like this:
  app.post('/api/movies', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);
  });
  
  The req.body will now contain:
  {
    title: "Inception",
    year: 2010,
    rating: 8.8,
    actor: ["Leonardo", "Joseph", "Ellen"]
  }

3. Why Is It Needed?
  By default, Express does not know how to parse the body, of an incoming request.
  Without express.json(), the req.body would be undefined for JSON payloads.

4. When to Use It?
  Use express.json() when:
    Your application receives requests with a JSON body.
    You want to handle data submitted via POST, PUT, or PATCH methods.

Example:-
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/api/movies', (req, res) =>{
    const movie = req.body;
    movie.id = movies.length+1;
    movies.push(movie);
    res.send(movie);
})

IMP Ques:- About middleware [you can see example of below ques in chatGPT.]
1. In express, what is the purpose of the next() function in middleware functions?
   Ans:- To parse controll the next middleware function, in the stack.

2. While designing a REST API in for a blog platform how would you enable clients to fetch a list of all comments associated with a specific blog?
   Ans:  GET /blogs/123/comments

3. In your Express application, you need to restrict access to certain routes. What is the best approach to implement this authorization feature?
   Ans: We should implement reusable Middleware, that verifies permission before processing req.
   Create reusable middleware functions to handle authorization logic,
   These functions will check whether a user has the required permissions before allowing access to the route.

4. Middleware function are executed in the order, they are added to app.
