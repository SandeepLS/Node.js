/*
Events in Node.js
Every action on a computer is an event. Like when a connection is made or a file is opened.
Objects in Node.js can fire events, like the readStream object fires events when opening and closing a file:
*/
Ex:-
var fs = require('fs');
var rs = fs.createReadStream('./demofile.txt');
rs.on('open', function () {
  console.log('The file is open');
});
