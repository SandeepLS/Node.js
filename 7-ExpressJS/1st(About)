Reffer:-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-vs-express-js/
Express:-It is a Fast(It make sense), Unopinionated(It will allow it to u whatever we want.express say do whatever u want), Minimalist web framework for Node.js

(i)We want to use express in our project, So first we get express in our code.(then how we can get, Using require function).
Basically express comming from the third-part-services, It means npm.
so that's wy we should install express in npmjs.com-> (npm install express)
when we install express will get other module as well, the other module depends on express.
Ex:-
const express = require('express')
var app = express();

(ii)then we want start the server:-
const express = require('express')
var app = express();
app.listen(9000);
(:- go to the browser type: localhost:9000)u will get-> Connect Get/
our server is up and running.

(iii)i want to print here server is started or not
const express = require('express')
var app = express();
app.listen(9000, function(req,res){
    console.log("Running...");
})
(:- it will apear in Terminal)

(iv)we wanted to print Hello World.How, To achive that we have to understand the concept of Router/Routing.
example,we have a website, will be having multiple links, for different types of links we will pass different request, for that request will be having different response,
So how to handle a particuler request is decided with the help of Routing concept.

we use express concept, we specified the route,
app.get -> get is simply fetching data from ther server.

The get will tahe two parameter, 
1st:-is your URL :- app.get('/',)->Your requesting for Homepage.
2nd:- once will send the request, we have to execute that function right:-app.get('/',function(req,res))
      req:-is the data is going client to server
      res:-is the data is going server to client.
Ex:-
const express = require('express')
var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req,res){
    res.send("Hello World");
})

app.listen(9000, function(req,res){
    console.log("Running...");
})
(:- go to the browser type: localhost:9000)u will get-> Hello World.

(V)when we request to alien page:-/alien
app.get('/alien', function(req,res){
    res.send("Welcome back alien");
})
