Client:-
A Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service,
from the service providers (Servers).

Server:-
A Server is a remote computer that provides information (data) or access to particular services.

A client send a request to the server, the server access request from the client,
then server give response back to the client, which will be information render on the website.

How the Browser Interacts With the Servers:-
There are a few steps to follow to interacts with the servers of a client:
  User enters the URL(Uniform Resource Locator) of the website or file,
  The Browser then requests the DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) Server.
  DNS Server lookup for the address of the WEB Server.
  The DNS Server responds with the IP address of the WEB Server.
  The Browser sends over an HTTP/HTTPS request to the WEB Serverâ€™s IP (provided by the DNS server).
  The Server sends over the necessary files for the website.
  The Browser then renders the files and the website is displayed,
  This rendering is done with the help of DOM (Document Object Model) interpreter, CSS interpreter, and 
  JS Engine collectively known as the JIT or (Just in Time) Compilers.
