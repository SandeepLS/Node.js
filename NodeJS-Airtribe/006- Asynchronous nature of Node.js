Asynchronous/Non-blocking  nature of Node.js:-
NodeJS is single threaded, meaning it doesn't support mylti threaded.
However NodeJS application are highly scalabel, due to the Asynchronous nature of NodeJS.(Doing other task, while one task to complete)
  Ex:- washing our cloths in washing machine and start in, & in a synchronous system we would sit and watch the machine, until it finishes(we can't do anything else).
       that's not very effecient our time, insted by washing machine is running, we gohead do other task may be we read a book, have a cup of coffe, 
       we are not stuck waiting for the washing machine to finish it. we are free to do other task. & when the washing is done we are take out the cloths, and hung them to try.
